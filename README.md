            <li>It is grown to become a powerful brand more than a century later and is now helmed by Muneer Ahmed and Naseer Ahmed, direct descendants of Hasin Baig. <br></li>
            <li>It has also sparked a bunch of clones, creating confusion in the mind of any visitor or gourmand who visits Ambur for a plate of the real deal.<br></li>
            <LI> Some of my friends in Ambur prefer the slightly nondescript Rahmaniya hotel, one of the three establishments that Star Briyani manages in Ambur. </LI>
